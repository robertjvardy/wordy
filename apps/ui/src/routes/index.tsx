            <strong>Wordy</strong> is a word puzzle game where players have six
            attempts to guess a secret five-letter word. After each guess, the
            game provides feedback:

            Once a player completes a game (by either guessing the word
            correctly or running out of attempts), they have the opportunity to
            compare their scores with their friends who have also completed the
            same word.
